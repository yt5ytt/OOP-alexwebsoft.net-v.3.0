<div class="aboutMe">
  <p>Hello. My name is Alex. I'm from Serbia.</p>

  <p>I'm PHP FullStack responsive web developer skilled in HTML5 / CSS3 and OOP PHP MVC / MySQL. I'm constantly learning web technologies since January 2015. Beside skills above, I'm using JavaScript and jQuery libraries when it's needed. I'm very passionate about web development and everything related. I'm also WordPress enthusiast, so I'm trying to be WP developer and to make my own themes and plugins in it.</p>

  <p>At first I used procedural PHP coding. For a long time I was under opinion that is only what I need to be a PHP developer. BUT!!!... In meanwhile, some project that I've made was needed to update, so when I start to administrate them, it was very hard to manage that task, because PHP scripts are 2k - 3k wide. Then I realize that I must do something... Now I'm familiar with OOP PHP concept. I developed my own convention of file architecture, separate to classes and MVC modal of software process.</p>

  <p>All of my code is completely unique. I'm very interested to learn Laraver PHP framework. I've bought a book about it and have plans to learn that too. I'm working in OOP PHP with MVC framework and grid CSS3.</p>

  <p>When I'm working, I can adjust my local web server to be available, so you can monitor how your websites are growing live. Also you can follow code development on GitHub.</p>

  <p>
    Currently my skills includes:
    <ul>
      <li>HTML5, CSS3;</li>
      <li>OOP PHP, MVC and MySQL;</li>
      <li>Python;</li>
      <li>Working with JQuery libraries;</li>
      <li>Responsive Web Design;</li>
      <li>WordPress CMS;</li>
      <li>WordPress Development;</li>
      <li>Familiar with Joomla CMS;</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>For development, I write HTML5, CSS3 and OOP PHP, MVC with MySQL queries. For those interested, the text editor I use is Atom and WAMP web server to build sites locally. These are the basic tools I use on every job and are my daily set up.</p>

  <p>If you have any business ideas, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm open for every opportunity.</p>

  <p>Best regards!</p>
